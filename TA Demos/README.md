| Testing | These demos cover how to write doctests and unittests in Python. It is a useful skill to learn how to write high-quality tests in order to ensure that your programs behaves as expected. Recall what paths that a test can be written in (e.g., happy, sad, boundary). Also, recall the concept of pre and post-conditions from the lecture slides. It is important to learn these skills as they will be reinforced in LE/EECS 1022, LE/EECS 2030, LE/EECS 2101, LE/EECS 3311, and so on. | [Doctest API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html), [unittest API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
