Jusqu'ici tout va bien
Jusqu'ici tout va bien
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights you stole, ah
Fucked up, the balance in my head
But it's all good
I'll see you again another
(Dream) Ah
But I miss the way the sun streamed through my window
And I miss the way you almost held the tide
But still it's nice, dreaming that you're somewhere
Feeling the same heat that I did
Another time (I know, I know, I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me
Walk the line
I said I'd walk you home but we still went our own way
The tears lost in rain on your cheekbones in silence
And I pulled my head out the darkness in your house
Can't stay 'til the morning, refracted my way out
From nightmares in my car, as I lay beside you
And fucked up my timeline and twisted your end with
So much still to go, as the sun sets behind you
I can't let it go, you can't hold me
I can't always, oh
Talk it out
Cut me off
Chalk it down
To my head
Ba-balancing my head, ah
Slow it down
Rise and fall
Chalk it down
To my head down, down
And I miss the way (Talk it out)
The sun streamed through my window (Cut me off)
And I miss the way (Chalk it down)
You almost held the tide (To my head)
But still it's nice (Balancing my head)
Dreaming that you're somewhere (Slow it down)
Feeling the same heat that I did (Rise and fall)
No fear no fall (Chalk it down) (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me (To my head)
Still I got nothing, woah
Comme les nuits quand je ne savais pas encore
Comme les nuits qui m'ont appris à aimer les adieux
Comme les nuits quand on croyais que tout irais bien
Mais cela n'a pas d'importance car les nuits
Bruyantes, brilliantes
Bruyantes, brilliantes
Bruyantes, brilliantes
Sont toutes pareilles à la fin
