| Week 1: Getting Started | In this slide deck, we discuss the introductory content from week 1 and motivate its importance. In particular, we discuss the different paths and research areas of computer science. Then, we go over the weekly deliverables. Lastly, a short Q & A period is held for the students to voice any questions or concerns arising from the assigned deliverables. |
| Week 2: Building Blocks I-II and Debugging | In this slide deck, we discuss the basic building blocks of Python and emphasize how to use Strings. A demo of how to debug a simple program is also provided using the Wing IDE. Lastly, a short Q & A is held for students to ask questions and voice their concerns.
| Week 3: Functions and Test-Driven Development | In this slide deck, we go over the importance of functions, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and test-driven development. A case-study is provided with the corresponding code. Lastly, a short Q & A period is held for students to ask questions and voice their concerns. Lab 3 tips and/or tricks are discussed in-person (whiteboard).
| Week 4: Functions and Local or Global Variable Scope | In this slide deck, we go over functions (method signatures) and unit testing. A case-study is provided with corresponding code. Explanations will be provided in-person. You are encouraged to make your own questions and share them with peers :)
| Week 6: Modules and Functiosn II| In this slide deck, we go over modules and functions. In particular, the **math** and **random** modules are comprehensively discussed. A case-study and Jupyter notebook are provided to gain hands-on experience.
