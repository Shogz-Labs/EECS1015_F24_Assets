# LE/EECS1015: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

Welcome to **LE/EECS 1015 Section A (LAB 04)**! The goal of this repository is to help students familiarize themselves with programming in Python to solve computational problems. You will learn about data types, control structures, and data structures.

**__Commonly Asked Questions__**

1. Where do I submit Lab 1 (Task 3)? I cannot find it on eClass!

   - You can find the submission box from the **course calendar**. Make sure that you look under **Friday, 20 September 2024**.

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. For Q1, do I submit all of the components?
   - No, please only submit the last component to PrarieLearn.

2. How do I convert a data type from one type to another? (e.g., float to integer)
   - You should refer to functions such as int(...) or float(...). 

3. How do I get the maximum number from Lab 1 and Lab 2? 
   - You can technically use if-else, however, I encourage you to take a look at the in-built functions that Python supports. 

4. How do I round a float to two decimal places?
   - Please read the documentation for the round(...) function.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me during the scheduled lab session!! üôå

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am struggling with the phone number validation. Can you give me a hint?
   - Break the problem down. First, check that the String is made up of the proper characters (numbers, brackets, and dashes). 
   - If this passes, then you need to ensure that the length-requirement is met. Only consider the numerical characters.
