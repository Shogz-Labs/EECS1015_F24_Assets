**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am struggling with the phone number validation. Can you give me a hint?
   - Break the problem down. First, check that the String is made up of the proper characters (numbers, brackets, and dashes). 
   - If this passes, then you need to ensure that the length-requirement is met. Only consider the numerical characters.

### Session 4: Friday October 11

| Task 5: Implementation (XOR) (/10) | NA | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 6: Implementation ($x^2 - y^2$) (/10) | Write each assertion one at a time. Consider the ordering of each assertion prior to writing any code. | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am confused by the method signature. What are argument annotations? How do I specify the return type of a function?

   Please see the example below.

   ```python
   def check_for_good_vibes(bio: str) -> bool:
      return True
   ```

   Essentially, the method signature tells us (1) the data type you expect for each argument, and (2) what data type the function is expected to return. 

   In the above example, the function ```check_for_good_vibes(bio)``` expects one argument with a string data type. It is expected to return a boolean value (True, False).

2. For Task 1, I have copied the code but my doctest is failing! Why is this happening to me!?

   Please make sure that you have copied it exactly. Whitespaces and individual character differences from the existing code will throw errors. Doctest is very sensitive, haha. 

3. I am totally lost for task 6: $x^2 - y^2$... Can you offer me some guidance?

   Read the instructions carefully. Before you start writing any code, consider the order of assertions that makes sense to test for.

   **Do not try to write one single assertion to handle all of the test cases!!!! Break it down into components.**

### Session 5: Friday October 25
| Task | Hints | Submission |

| Task 6: Implementation (Even Numbers)(/10) | N/A | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am having difficulty understanding how to solve Task 2. Why does the code not work properly? How can I fix it?

   Firstly, it is important to understand that the variables **x** and **y** are **global**. This means that the state of the variables are **shared** across all of the functions and main method. 

   Now, given this, take a look at function1 and function2. 

   function1 relies on **y** to instantiate **x**. 
   
   This means that we must **initialize** the value of **y** first before we assign **x**. 

2. For Task 4, how should I be decomposing the given function into smaller components? Can you give me some advice?

   Try to think about the code structure in terms of maintainability. Consider if it would be easier to debug code and write unit tests if independent functions are responsible for calculating yours and the opponents scores!

### Session 6: Friday November 1

1. The exam will be in-person, running for **90** minutes.  
2. You will only be allowed to use the lab computers. This means that you must set up an EECS account. If you haven't done so, please see: [https://webapp.eecs.yorku.ca/activ8/](https://webapp.eecs.yorku.ca/activ8/) 
3. The structure of the midterm is as follows, covering material from Weeks 1 - 7 (including Functions III):
   - 10 Multiple-Choice
   - 2 Coding Questions
   - 1 Debugging Question
4. The test is closed-book. Once the test begins, the desktops will enter lab-test mode. You will have limited internet access and all of your files saved in /home/ will be unavailable. 

Good luck, you've got this!!

| Task 4: Implementation (Caesar) (/10) | Make sure that you account for the shift going past the original end of the alphabet. In ASCII, A - Z is synonymous with 65 - 90 (ASCII). While this can be done in many ways, using a List may make things more clear. | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)|

| Task 6: Implementation (Remove Vowels) (/10) | N/A | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

**Commonly Asked Questions**
1. I am having problems with Task 3. Why are my summations negative?

   The problem is likely due to how you are computing the numerator. You need to account for BEDMAS. 
   For example, see below:

   ```python
   example_1 = -1 ** 2 
   example_2 = (-1) ** 2

   print(example_1)
   # Output: -1 

   print(example_2)
   # Output: 1
   ```


2. I am having difficulty with Task 2. I don't understand the for-loop part of the program.

   Please refer to the documentation here: [range(....)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range)

3. I am having problems with Task 5. I can get the shift to work for some but not all of the characters. How do I deal with the wrap-around constraint?

   You need to use the modulo (%) operator to deal with the wrap-around and prevent overflow. 
   Modulo returns the remainder after long division. 

   So, if you modulo your preliminary result by 26, it ensures that your index will not fall outside of the supported range.

   Run the following code below to get an intuition of how modulo works:
   ```python
   for i in range(1000):
      print(f'{i} % 26 = {i % 26}')
   ```

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am having trouble understanding how to implement the intersecting character requirement. Can you give me some hints or direction?

   Please refer to the [set()](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) documentation. Play around with the constructor; try to pass a string into it and see what happens. From there, the rest should follow quite quickly.

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am having trouble with the sorting requirement for Task 3 (Majority Element). How can I deal with this?

   Please check that you are not returning collection.sort(). The method sorts the collection in-place and returns None. 
   You may want to use sorted() instead in the last line of your return statement.

### Session  10: Friday November 29

Part 1 

| Task | Hints | Submission |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Task 1: Follow the Steps (Separate Numbers) (/30) | N/A | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 2: Debugging (Highest Correlation) (/30) | Fix the syntax errors first; your IDE should highlight where things are incorrect or missing. From there, focus on the logic of each method. | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 3: Implementation ($n \times n$ Tic-Tac-Toe) (/20) | **Do not try to tackle all of the methods at once.** Implement each method, write doctest, and test it. Do not move on until each method from top-down works. **It is vital that you understand nested for-loops, boolean expressions, and/or list comprehension.** | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

Part 2

| Task | Hints | Submission |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Task 1: Follow the Steps (Rectangle Class) (/50) | N/A | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 2: Debugging (Inventory Management) (/30) | **Carefully read over each provided method prior to fixing any logical errors.** Consider how to implement equality checking among class objects. | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. My Pearson Correlation code isn't working! The wrong list is being returned... Why is this happening?

   Double check the logic with ```max_correlation```. Use the debugger and step through the code line-by-line. 
   You can also step into your other methods to make sure that everything is working properly.

2. I am just lost with the $n \times n$ Tic-Tac-Toe problem. How can I check for a winner?

   Break the problem down conceptually. The class emphasizes decomposing a complex problem into manageable components.
   With that being said, consider writing methods to:
   
   - Check if a player has won by securing a **horizontal** row win.
   - Check if a player has won by securing a **vertical** column win.
   - Check if a player has won by securing a **diagonal** win condition. Do note that there are two diagonal win-conditions! 

   **Hint:** You will need to have an understanding of nested-loops to complete this task efficiently.

3. My ```stock_product(...)``` method is throwing errors... I don't understand what is expected of me here....

   Firstly, make sure that you have fixed all of the prior syntax and logic errors.
   
   The method should increase the quantity of a product in the Inventory if it already exists (e.g., same name, same price).
   If the product doesn't exist, add it to the inventory. 

   **Hint:** Read through the classes and its associated methods. The bulk of the code to solve this problem have been provided to you by the Instructors.
