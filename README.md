# LE/EECS1015: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

Welcome to **LE/EECS 1015 Section A (LAB 04)**! The goal of this repository is to help students familiarize themselves with programming in Python to solve computational problems. You will learn about data types, control structures, and data structures.

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. For Q1, do I submit all of the components?
   - No, please only submit the last component to PrarieLearn.

2. How do I convert a data type from one type to another? (e.g., float to integer)
   - You should refer to functions such as int(...) or float(...). 

3. How do I get the maximum number from Lab 1 and Lab 2? 
   - You can technically use if-else, however, I encourage you to take a look at the in-built functions that Python supports. 

4. How do I round a float to two decimal places?
   - Please read the documentation for the round(...) function.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me during the scheduled lab session!! 🙌

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am struggling with the phone number validation. Can you give me a hint?
   - Break the problem down. First, check that the String is made up of the proper characters (numbers, brackets, and dashes). 
   - If this passes, then you need to ensure that the length-requirement is met. Only consider the numerical characters.

### Session 4: Friday October 11
| Task | Hints | Submission |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Task 1: Follow the Steps (/30) | N/A | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 2: Debugging ($x^2 - y^2$) (/30) | NA | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login) | 
| Task 3: Implementation (Wheels) (/10) | NA | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 4: Implementation (Tickets) (/10)  | NA| [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 5: Implementation (XOR) (/10) | NA | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 
| Task 6: Implementation ($x^2 - y^2$) (/10) | Write each assertion one at a time. Consider the ordering of each assertion prior to writing any code. | [PrarieLearn](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/login)| 

**Commonly Asked Questions**

1. I am confused by the method signature. What are argument annotations? How do I specify the return type of a function?

   Please see the example below.

   ```python
   def check_for_good_vibes(bio: str) -> bool:
      return True
   ```

   Essentially, the method signature tells us (1) the data type you expect for each argument, and (2) what data type the function is expected to return. 

   In the above example, the function ```check_for_good_vibes(bio)``` expects one argument with a string data type. It is expected to return a boolean value (True, False).

2. For Task 1, I have copied the code but my doctest is failing! Why is this happening to me!?

   Please make sure that you have copied it exactly. Whitespaces and individual character differences from the existing code will throw errors. Doctest is very sensitive, haha. 

3. I am totally lost for task 6: $x^2 - y^2$... Can you offer me some guidance?

   Read the instructions carefully. Before you start writing any code, consider the order of assertions that makes sense to test for.

   **Do not try to write one single assertion to handle all of the test cases!!!! Break it down into components.**
